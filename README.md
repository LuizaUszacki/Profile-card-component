## Notes
I think the most difficult think about this website was to align the background images in the same place as it was in the challenge's image.
I even thought about trying to use functions to return the same value as where it should be positioned.
But in the end, I searched on internet about it and found the solution.
It was supriseling easier than what I thought lol.
And now... To be honest, I'm happy, because, after trying a lot, I finished the project exactly like I wanted it to be and I also learned something new.
